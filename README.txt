Currently minimum viable product.

Using a sqlite3 database and a text file containing developer API for CTA, we provide an interactive 
terminal-based application for monitoring specific stops. The goal is to avoid heavy-duty map-based searching
for commonly-used stops.

Todos: Better formatting, implement new stop addition and other interactive features (changing refresh rate, etc). Perhaps
display the stops that are tracked but not currently running?
